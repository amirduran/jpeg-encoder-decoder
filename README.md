# jpeg-encoder-decoder

I worked on this project during 2012. Group of students implemented image editing software called ETFShop where students collaborated in order to create Photoshop like software. My task was to implement JPEG encode and decoder that is able to open/read and write/save .jpeg images. 

Inside this library you will find my final report about JPEG endoding/decoding that can help you to understand how things are working. It is written in Bosnian language, but feel free to translate it.


[Open PDF documentation](https://github.com/amirduran/jpeg-encoder-decoder/blob/master/JPEG%20Filter%20Osnove%20JPEG%20kodiranja.pdf)

This is C++ implementation of the JPEG encoder and decoder. This library will save image object as JPEG file, but will also decode JPEG file into valid image object.

Here you can see, step by step, how JPEG standard works, and how JPEG image is created.
